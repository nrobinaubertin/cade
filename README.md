# Dave

Dave (Developer's Automated Virtual Environment) is an attempt at making a scripted environment suitable for the development and testing of charms.  

Goals:
- only one POSIX shell script
- multipass should be the only requirement
- mounts the developer's home directory to bring his tooling in the env
- focused on juju: any version should be installable
- easy deployment of multiple types of clouds
- offline deployment (?)

This is very much a work in progress.
